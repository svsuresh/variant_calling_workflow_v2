# Amplicon workflow with snakemake

This workflow is for short amplicon with two aligners (BWA and Bowtie2) and at the end, counts bases
- overall
- per base on both the strands
- per base on each strand

In addition, it also allows user to calculate non-ref allele fraction against refererence allele.
